# Week 4: Getting and Cleaning Data Project
ReadMe File


The final product can be seen in the file "tidydata.txt".
This repository is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera module.
The R script I've included named `run_analysis.R`, may perform the following:

1. Download the dataset as set it as your working directory
2. Load the activity and show the information
3. Load both the training and test datasets, retaining those columns which display a mean or standard deviation
4. Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and combines those columns with the dataset
5. Combine the two datasets
6. Convert activity and subject columns into factors
7. Create a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The End!
