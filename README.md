# Week 4: Getting and Cleaning Data Project
ReadMe - SKSC

This repository is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera module.
The R script I've included named `run_analysis.R`, may perform the following:

1. Download the dataset as found in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature information
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, retaining those columns which display a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and combines those columns with the dataset
5. Combines the two datasets
6. Converts activity and subject columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The final product can be seen in the file "tidydata.txt".
